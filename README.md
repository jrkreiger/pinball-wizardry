# Pinball Wizardry
_A web scraping, regex, and data visualization project (in progress)_

This is a project about pinball machines, inspired by [Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com/) and the [Internet Pinball Database](https://www.ipdb.org/search.pl). My purpose in this project is to gather and visualize some data about pinball machines, practicing my web scraping, regex, and Tableau skills along the way.

Here's what you'll find in this repo: 
* **pinball-wizardry.ipynb**: a Jupyter notebook containing project code.

To run the notebook on your own machine, you'll need Python 3 and the following packages:
* re
* requests
* time
* bs4

This is a work in progress, so check back for updates.
